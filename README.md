"Forecasting earthquakes is one of the most important problems in Earth science because of their devastating consequences. Current scientific studies related to earthquake forecasting focus on three key points: when the event will occur, where it will occur, and how large it will be.

In this competition, you will address when the earthquake will take place. Specifically, youâ€™ll predict the time remaining before laboratory earthquakes occur from real-time seismic data. "

In this repository, you can find two notebooks, containing :
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Deep learning model engineering (RNN)
